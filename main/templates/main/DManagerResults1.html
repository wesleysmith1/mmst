        The worker's target was {{player.group.final_target}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The worker's actual performance was {{worker_decodes}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was a <b>{{difficulty}} period</b>.
        (Recall that each period the computer will randomly determine if it is a normal or difficult period, 
        with an {{prob_easy}}% likelihood of being a normal period and a {{prob_difficult}}% likelihood of being a difficult period.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Your earnings for the period before any amount toward the worker's bonus is {{player.payoff_lira}} Lira. {{player.decodes_earnings}} from the decoding task performed by the worker, 
        {{player.trivia_earnings}} from your performance on the trivia questions,
        and {{manager_salary}} from your salary.
    </p>
    <p>
        {% if target_reached %}
            The worker met the target. 
        {% else %}
            The worker did not meet the target.
        {% endif %}
        As the manager, you can adjust the worker's bonus of {{group.bonus}} Lira 
        to any amount you see fit{% if target_reached %} (up or down){% endif%}. You will be responsible for paying 10% of the bonus from your own earnings. Would you like to adjust the worker's bonus?
