    <p>
        You will earn 10 Lira for each question the worker correctly adjusts during the two-

        question.

        The standard bonus for the company is 200 Lira if the worker achieves the set target
        during the period. You will learn the workerâ€™s performance and you have discretion as to
        their final bonus amount. You will pay 10% of any bonus you award to the worker.
        Remember that you will not be paired with the same worker next period.
