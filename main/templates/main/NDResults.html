            The manager was informed this was a <b>{{difficulty}} period</b>. 
            (Recall that each period the computer will randomly determine if it is a normal or difficult period,

            Your pay for the period is {{payoff_lira}} Lira. {{player.decodes_earnings}} from task performance, {{player.group.bonus}} from the bonus,
            and {{worker_salary}} from your salary.

            Remember that you will not be paired with the same manager next period.
