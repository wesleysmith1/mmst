    <p>
        In todayâ€™s study there will be two roles, WORKER and MANAGER. Workers will be
        responsible for performing a production task overseen by the manager. The production
        task will be repeated for ten periods and each period will last for two minutes. A worker
        will be paired with a manager for a period and these pairings will be rematched before
        each period, meaning you will not be matched with the same person in back-to-back
        periods. In each production period, the worker will have a performance target. The details
        of the production task, target-setting process and compensation will be described for your
        assigned role on the next screens.

        Note: At no time will any deception be used in this study, all instructions will be
        faithfully executed in accordance with the review of the Institutional Review Board.
